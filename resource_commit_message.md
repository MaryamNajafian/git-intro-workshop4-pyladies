# Useful Commit Messages

## Commit log
* it is a list of changes
* a list of actions you (or someone) have taken that have resulted in versions of the work

>"commits should really contain whole ideas of completed work"

>"Don’t beat yourself up for a big, messy commit with a vague label like "fixed the header"— just know that better is possible and aim for it when you can."

## Be Useful
* summarize the change
* make it useful to you and your teammates
* avoid editorializing:  _"alas, finally it works"_
* include reference to bug, issue or pull request

**Takeaway:**  Write a message that describes what changed in the commit, as clearly and succinctly as you can.

## Be Detailed (enough)
* keep commit message to one line, 70 characters

## Be Consistent
* establish conventions with your team
* write a wiki of examples of good & bad commit messages 

## Use the Active Voice
* pick a tense and stick with it (present, past)

## Examples of Bad Commit Messages :no_entry:

* "Version 2.0, Aug 1st deliverable"
* "finally, it works!"
