# Git Commit Messages: why they are so important

## To View Commit Messages:  `git log`
* Ideally, you should get a sense of how this project has evolved over time just from paging through git log’s output and scanning the log messages.
* Git can tell you as much or as little about your commits as you want, in virtually any format. 

## Options
#### to show log in condensed format
* `git log --pretty=oneline`
* `git log --oneline`

#### to show history in specific branch:  
`git log <branch_name>`
