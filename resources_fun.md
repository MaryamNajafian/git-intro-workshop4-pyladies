## `git log`
* Ideally, you should get a sense of how this project has evolved over time just from paging through git logâ€™s output and scanning the log messages.
* Git can tell you as much or as little about your commits as you want, in virtually any format. 

* `git log`  
* condensed format:  `git log --pretty=oneline`
